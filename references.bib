  abstract  = "Abstract The coalescent process is a powerful modeling tool for
               population genetics. The allelic states of all homologous gene
               copies in a population are determined by the genealogical and
               mutational history of these copies. The coalescent approach is
               based on the realization that the genealogy is usually easier to
               model backward in time, and that selectively neutral mutations
               can then be superimposed afterwards. A wide range of biological
               phenomena can be modeled using this approach. Whereas almost all
               of classical population genetics considers the future of a
               population given a starting point, the coalescent considers the
               present, while taking the past into account. This allows the
               calculation of probabilities of sample configurations under the
               stationary distribution of various population genetic models,
               and makes full likelihood analysis of polymorphism data
               possible. It also leads to extremely efficient computer
               algorithms for generating simulated data from such
               distributions, data which can then be compared with observations
               as a form of exploratory data analysis.",

               process the results of such simulations to efficiently calculate
               statistics of interest. We illustrate msprime's flexibility by
               implementing a simple (but functional) approximate Bayesian

  abstract = "A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to
              provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples.
              Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use
              approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage
              properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a
              substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies
              consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take
              advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these
              problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as
              the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact
              simulation of the coalescent with recombination for
              chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is
              possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate
              methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more
              quickly than with existing methods.",

  abstract  = "A method of testing the constant-rate neutral allele model of
               protein evolution is presented and applied to a large data set.
               The method uses the same statistic, $\chi$2 LF, used by Langley
               and Fitch (1973, 1974) and Fitch and Langley (1976). The
               distribution of $\chi$2 LF, characterized in this study with
               Monte Carlo simulations, depends on the parameter $\vartheta$
               (=4Nu). The values of $\vartheta$ required to explain the
               observed value of $\chi$2 LF are determined and found to be
               incompatible with the low levels of heterozygosity observed at
               the hemoglobin loci in humans. It is concluded that the
               constant-rate neutral model is highly improbable. Other neutral
