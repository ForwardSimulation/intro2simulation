               properties of this process can be studied, simultaneously for

@ARTICLE{Hudson1983-kn,
  title     = "Testing the {Constant-Rate} Neutral Allele Model with Protein
               Sequence Data",
  author    = "Hudson, Richard R",
  abstract  = "A method of testing the constant-rate neutral allele model of
               protein evolution is presented and applied to a large data set.
               The method uses the same statistic, $\chi$2 LF, used by Langley
               and Fitch (1973, 1974) and Fitch and Langley (1976). The
               distribution of $\chi$2 LF, characterized in this study with
               Monte Carlo simulations, depends on the parameter $\vartheta$
               (=4Nu). The values of $\vartheta$ required to explain the
               observed value of $\chi$2 LF are determined and found to be
               incompatible with the low levels of heterozygosity observed at
               the hemoglobin loci in humans. It is concluded that the
               constant-rate neutral model is highly improbable. Other neutral
               models and models involving natural selection need to be
               considered.",
